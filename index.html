											<h2>Why this workshop?</h2>
										</header>
										<p style="text-align:justify">
										Search engines such as Google, Bing and intelligent assistants such as IBM Watson, Siri and Cortana have demonstrated tremendous benefits to users from consuming data from the knowledge graphs. There are several well-known knowledge graphs such as DBpedia, Wikidata and Schema.org in the consumer space, but very little attention has been given to knowledge graphs in non-consumer space. One such key area where more and more applications are making use of the structured data in the form of knowledge graphs is in the Industrial businesses such as manufacturing, oil and gas, power, aviation and mining. Industrial knowledge graphs can play an important role in creating Artificial Intelligence applications in the Industrial space. There is less focus on such Industrial knowledge graphs in the main track of research conferences. Our goal is to use this workshop as an ideal platform to bridge this gap and bring together researchers and practitioners in the areas of Web Science, knowledge graphs along with Industry subject matter experts.
										<br/><br/>
										The aim of this workshop is to bring together people from diverse backgrounds to define and shape the vision of an Industrial knowledge graph by focusing on the following goals:
										<ul>
											<li>Discussion on the nature of knowledge graphs in an Industrial setting</li>
											<li>Identify the similarities and differences between consumer oriented and Industrial knowledge graphs</li>
											<li>Applications of knowledge graph in Industrial setting</li>
											<li>Provide a platform for discussion among researchers in Web Science, Industrial subject matter experts and knowledge graphs</li>
											<li>Identify future challenges</li>

												<h3><b>Keynote Talk: <em>Extracting, Aligning, and Linking Data to Build Knowledge Graphs</em></b></h3>
												<p>
												There is a huge amount of data spread across the web and stored in databases that we can use to build knowledge graphs. However, exploiting this data to build knowledge graphs is difficult due to the heterogeneity of the sources, scale in the amount of data, and noise in the data. In this talk I will present our approach to building knowledge graphs, including acquiring data from online sources, extracting information from those sources, aligning and linking the data across sources, and building and querying the knowledge graphs at scale. We applied our approach, implemented in a system called DIG, to a number of challenging real-world problems including combating human trafficking by analyzing web ads, identifying illegal arms sales from online marketplaces, and predicting cyber attacks using data extracted from both the open and dark web.   
												<br/><br/>
												Craig Knoblock is a Research Professor of both Computer Science and Spatial Sciences at the University of Southern California (USC), Research Director at the Information Sciences Institute, and Associate Director of the Informatics Program at USC.   He received his Bachelor of Science degree from Syracuse University and his Masterâ€™s and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in computer science. His research focuses on techniques for describing, acquiring, and exploiting the semantics of data.  He has worked extensively on source modeling, schema and ontology alignment, entity and record linkage, data cleaning and normalization, extracting data from the Web, and combining these techniques to build knowledge graphs.  He has published more than 250 journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers on these topics.  Dr. Knoblock is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), a Distinguished Scientist of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), a Senior Member of IEEE, past President and Trustee of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), and winner of the 2014 Robert S. Engelmore Award.
